## Notes

- I need to investigate when to use arrow functions versus traditional functions.
- It is challenging to create aesthetically pleasing websites and I am interested in improving my design skills.
- After working with C++ and Java, it took me some time to readjust to JS and I am eager to continue honing my skills.
